spring_social_samples
=====================

My sandbox projects to get familiar with Spring Social Framework

Persistent-Spring-Social-example : adaptation of Keith Donald spring-social-quickstart with a persistent jdbc based connection repository, works with Facebook.

Persistent-spring-social-linkedin : same as above but connecting to LinkedIn

Persistent-spring-social-generic : with abstraction layer on top of Service providers, enable toggling between facebook and linkedin

background-spring-social-facebook : use the jdbc connection repository to perform background operations with access to facebook data.

background-spring-social-generic : adaptation of the above for a generic access to connections to a service provider
